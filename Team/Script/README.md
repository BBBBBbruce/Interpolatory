- As high refresh rate screens become more common,
consumers have developed an appetite for high frame-rate video

OLLY
- However, many existing videos are between 24-30fps 
meaning that frame rate upconversion is needed

Because real-time processing is desirable
the resource-intensive task is better suited for hardware rather than software

Interpolatory offers an industry-first simulation suite for real-time frame rate upconversion
aiding design and development of products that tap the 1.67bn TV owner market

Interpolatory is powered by state of the art research done throughout the last 20 years
In fact, we offer an extensive literature review on over 75 papers,
which is suitable for engineers to get up to speed quickly

Interpolatory features a highly-featured software simulation tool
intended to help users quickly prototype different algorithms

1:03
NAIM
The tool has four core features, the first begin video frame conversion for any video.
Users can choose the target framerate and customise the frame-rate conversion algorithm used
Then, with a click of a button, the video is converted
and can be previewed to quickly gauge the algorithm's quality

OLLY
The second feature is benchmarking in which users can run the industry standard Middlebury benchmark on the algorithms
Using it is as simple as customising the algorithm, and clicking Run.
Upon completion, benchmark scores are given, allowing users to compare algorithms
Also, the interpolated frames are produced for visual inspection of the output

CHARLES
The third feature allows the users to interpolate any pair of frames,
effectively allowing the creation of custom benchmarks
Again, quantitative metrics are shown, together with the actual output for quantitative analysis

The fourth and final feature is hardware resource estimation.
Here, engineers can quickly estimate how much hardware resource is used by a certain algorithm at a certain frame size

We are proud of our extensive library of algorithms, and wish to share with you example output from a small selection of them.

We start off with a trivial and fast method: bilinear interpolation
This method just blends frames based on their weighted averages, producing fast but inaccurate results

2:53
NAIM
Next up is an improved algorithm that uses motion estimation and motion compensated interpolation
producing more accurate results as motion is taken into account

3:08
OLLY
And finally we have an advanced Convolutional Neural Network method, which incorporates residual learning to predict flow and interpolate frames

3:23
CHARLES
These are just the tip of the iceberg, and we hope to see you using Interpolatory
