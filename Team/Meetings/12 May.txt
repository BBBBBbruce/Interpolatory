1. Cloning repo
    => it's huge because I had junk videos
2. Running code
    => For those who tried, any problems?
    => Setting up env. (vscode server)
3. Splitting work
    => ME <type interface> MCI, ML
        
    => ME: define a MV type interface for MCI
        => Olly, Naim
        => type elem = {
            movement: <float, float>, (x,y)
            metric: float
        }
        => type MV = Array<elem>, raster scan per block
        
        MV countFlow(frame1, frame2):
            # blah

    => decide which block method?
        => do we try most, or the best we found?
        => start from trivial (Full Search)
        
    => MCI?
        => Charles, Bruce and Navid
        => not completely decoupled for MV type interface
        => median/mean method (unidirectional)
        => post processing is stretch goal
        => need to investigate bidirectional

        24 -> 60 (2.5)
        frame MCI(frame1, frame2, mv, ratio?):
            # blah

    => ML
        => if MEMC doesn't need extra hands, LH just go explore


    => Source videos: 
        => Find 60 or 120 fps (better) and downsample to 24, 25, 50
        => Target 60 and compare PSNR & SSIM to ground truth
        => I have links to videos, will look into this 


4. Timeline
    => Wednesday: give a rough timeline and expectations for Kieron, telling him what we need
    => We have two weeks until a leaflet deliverable - I will write a catch up email to our new supervisor today
