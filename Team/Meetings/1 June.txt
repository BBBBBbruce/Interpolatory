MEMCI OK

Deliverables deadline set out

FOCUS
how many pixels did we have to read and write from global arrays to produce a frame - 
DDR COST w.r.t burst reads/writes
REUSE SCHEMES 
M20K
soft logic

local buffering/caching 

30 bits/pixel 
16 pixels in a word 

worst case * 16

ddr burst best case is when we use all pixels 

model RW cache


-
onchip SRAM reuse data 
- how many M20K blocks 
- feasibility 

-
modules have not much value, but can go ahead
modelling ddr has higher value 

- gui ok 


======

i'll continue on the gui and the kwargs 
work on the video

talk to geroge this week

======

read up DDR
touch a bit on caches 
cache schemes?

DRAM -> off chip memory
ALU can be configured to storage/computation

=======

MAP has bugs but not implicating end results 
vectors look fine

=======
MCI gang gang -> fine tuning
